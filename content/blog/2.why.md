# Why Blogroject?

Blogging about building a blog on the blog being built.

This blogroject is all about me personally having fun learning Nuxt and Vue, but still having a guiding purpose. A secondary function is to keep me programming daily, even though my job no longer requires me to do so.
I also want to document the process as the site grows in a variety of ways, from features and technical techniques, to better writing style and tone, to the visual design of the blog itself.
